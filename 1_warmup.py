# Top Secret Encoder / Decoder
#
# This code is... broken!  (I don't know who wrote it.)
#
# Your challenge is to find the bug(s) and fix them, so that
# the program will properly encode any message and also
# decode it back to the original message.
#
# ---------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Here's how the encoder is supposed to work:
#
# 1. any uppercase letters should be considered lowercase
# 2. advance every letter by 3 places in the alphabet.
# 3. going past "z" should "rotate" back to to "a"
#
# The decoder function should reverse this process in order to
# recover the original message.
#
# Examples:
#
# hello  - should be encoded as -  khoor
# ZEBRA  - should be encoded as -  cheud
# Pizza  - should be encoded as -  slccd
